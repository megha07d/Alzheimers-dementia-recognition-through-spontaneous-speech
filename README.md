# Alzheimers-dementia-recognition-through-spontaneous-speech
Detect dementia by capturing the acoustic features of subjects through audio and automatic speech recognition technology, classify using Deep Learning techniques

1. Problem Definition
* Most of the studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been carried out using medical images.However, the acquisition of medical images data is difficult.
* The identification based on the patient's speech data can effectively reduce the medical cost, and the speech data can be collected
in a non-invasive manner so that the patient's data can be collected in real-time and accurately.
* This project uses a new method that uses the spectrogram features extracted from speech data to identify AD, which can help families to understand the disease development of patients in an earlier stage
3. Preliminary Research 
  * Literature Review
  * Web search
