# Alzheimers-dementia-recognition-through-spontaneous-speech
Detect dementia by capturing the acoustic features of subjects through audio and automatic speech recognition technology, classify using Deep Learning techniques

### 1. Problem Definition
* Most of the studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been carried out using medical images.However, the acquisition of medical images data is difficult.
* The identification based on the patient's speech data can effectively reduce the medical cost, and the speech data can be collected
in a non-invasive manner so that the patient's data can be collected in real-time and accurately.
* This project uses a new method that uses the spectrogram features extracted from speech data to identify AD, which can help families to understand the disease development of patients in an earlier stage

### 2. Data Collection
* ADReSS (Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech) Challenge dataset is used.
* The Cookie Theft Picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination.

* For the PD task, the examiner asks subjects to describe the picture by saying, "Tell me everything you see going on in this picture". Then subjects response is recorded
### 3. Data Preparation
* 86 ad subjects
* 78 normal subjects
6. Data Exploration and Visualization
7. Deep Learning Model
8. Model Architecture Design
9. Model Compilation and Training
10. Model Evaluation
